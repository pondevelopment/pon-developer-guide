# pon-developer-guide
The Pon developer guide, guidelines, standards and best practices.

## Introduction
Ahoy there fellow Developer 👋 This repository is a good starting point for accelerating your ability to contribute towards our projects, yay! Scouts rules apply, so please keep this page up to date for your colleagues (or future self).

## Best practices

- [The Boy Scout rule](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1235624&seqNum=6) - Leave your code better than you found it.
- Good, clean and secure code as defined by: "*How much effort is required for another developer of comparable experience to pick up where the previous developer left off to fix, enhance or build upon the source code - without involving the former developer and taking into account the lifetime, quality, security and the business impact of the application.*"
- When reviewing take this cardinal, fundamental law of programming into account: ["It’s harder to read code than to write it."](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/)

## Documentation
A developer should be a able to self-start by using the documentation available in the source code repository. Github is the preferred hub for (a reference to) all related project and product documentation.

## Recommended software
Every crafts person has his/her preferred tools. While you are free to choose what works best for you, below you will find a list of recommended software to aid you in your development activities:

### Pull requests

Pull requests are an important tool for code quality, in summary the Pon best practices for pull requests are:

- Keep your pull requests small
- The title contains the issue reference
- A pull request handles about a single issue or ticket (linting updates are usually considered a single issue)

For more details please refer to [pull requests best practices](https://github.com/pondevelopment/pon-developer-guide/blob/main/pull-requests.md)
