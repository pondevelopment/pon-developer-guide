## Introduction
Ahoy there fellow Developer ðŸ‘‹ This repository is a good starting point for accelerating your ability to contribute towards our projects, yay! Scouts rules apply, so please keep this page up to date for your colleagues (or future self).

## Best practices

- [The Boy Scout rule](https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1235624&seqNum=6) - Leave your code better than you found it.
- Good, clean and secure code as defined by: "*How much effort is required for another developer of comparable experience to pick up where the previous developer left off to fix, enhance or build upon the source code - without involving the former developer and taking into account the lifetime, quality, security and the business impact of the application.*"
- When reviewing take this cardinal, fundamental law of programming into a account: ["Itâ€™s harder to read code than to write it."](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/04/06/things-you-should-never-do-part-i/)
