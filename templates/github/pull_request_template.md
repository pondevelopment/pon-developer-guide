Pull Request Template
=======

### Step-by-step guide
How to add a pull request template to your GitHub repository

1. Create a `.github` folder in the root of your repository if it doesnâ€™t exist.
2. Inside the `.github` folder, create a markdown file named `pull_request_template.md`.
3. Add the markdown from below to the `pull_request_template.md`.
4. Commit and push your changes.
5. Now, whenever someone creates a pull request in your repository, the content of the `pull_request_template.md` file will automatically appear in the pull request description box.

Remember, you can customize the template according to the specific needs of your project. The template below is just a starting point.
